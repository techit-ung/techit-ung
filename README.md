#### Yo! Did you just just fumble across my profile? 😁

### I'm Techit btw, you can call me Te _(pronounce it like Tay in Taylor)_.

#### I'm a software enthusiast 👨‍💻. I LOVE everything about software and way to solve things.
- You can take a look at fun projects I did while I'm learning Go and Rust.
- But you can ask me about Kotlin, Android related stuffs, and web stuffs too. I'll be glad to help! 

🖖 Peace!
